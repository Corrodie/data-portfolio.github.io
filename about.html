									<h1>Meet the Analyst</h1>

									<p>My name is Meg Yohn, and I am an entry level data analyst.</p>
                                    <p>A few months ago I embarked on a project that changed my outlook on my career path - I didn't know what data analysis was, I hadn't even heard the term, but the project I decided to do was exactly that. A few weeks after finishing my first draft of the project while looking on a job searching site, that term crossed my path and I thought "What is that? It sounds interesting!" and found that I'd already been doing it - "improperly," but doing it nonetheless.</p>
                                    <p>I decided to pursue it as a secondary career, (and perhaps, eventually, a primary...who knows what the future holds!) and enrolled in the Google Data Analytics course, which I have since graduated from. I am now taking the IBM Data Analytics course, hope to take some statistics classes after and continue to practice my fluency, continuing to learn through programs such as DataCamp and Kaggle projects.</p>
                                    <P>Although I am very fresh, I am driven, learn fast, and have a genuine thirst for knowledge and growth. If you invest a bit into training me up to where I need to be - I can be the best employee you've ever had. I don't stop until I have an answer; and that's why this work calls to me.</P>
                                    <p>I currently have experience in Excel, Rstudio, SQL Server/BigQuery/SQLite, Cognos, and Tableau. Due to being enrolled in the IBM program, I am currently working on attaining knowledge in Python, PowerBI, and others. Additionally, I know some HTML and CSS, and have stuck my toes in Ruby before - I didn't get far and don't remember any of it, but the point is that I'm open to learning anything.</p>
                                    <p><strong>My dream is to one day bring both of my favorite fields together: performing analysis in the shelter world full-time and acting as a consultant to help animal welfare advance.</strong> I don't know that I see a huge market for that right now - I haven't seen the listings, but...who knows, maybe I can create it? Time will tell!</p>
                                    <p>But what about me, as a person? In my spare time, I enjoy learning new things, reading, listening to music, spending time with my cats, perfecting my espresso drinks, and hiking when I have the opportunity.</p>
